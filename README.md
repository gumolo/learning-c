# learning-c

Codes from my personal experimentation with C. Not a course.

## Overview

This repository contains small C programs and snippets. The goal is exploration and experimentation, not structured teaching material or best practices. Expect minimal examples.

## Requirements

On Debian or Ubuntu-based systems, install the required tools:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc
```

## Building an Example

To compile a C file (for example, `hello.c`):

```bash
gcc hello.c -o run
```
